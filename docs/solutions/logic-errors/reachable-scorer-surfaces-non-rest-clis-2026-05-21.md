# Scorecard scorers must follow reachable command surfaces

## Problem

Several scorecard dimensions assumed generated REST scaffolding was the canonical implementation surface. For JSON-RPC or other non-REST CLIs, the real command behavior can live in a sibling package such as `internal/<api>/`, while the generic `internal/client` scaffold is absent or intentionally removed.

## Symptoms

- Error handling, output modes, and sync correctness were under-scored even when a registered command delegated to richer sibling-package code.
- Renamed sync command files, such as `sync_<api>.go`, missed sync credit when the runtime Cobra mirror made them reachable.
- Nested Cobra subcommands were invisible when only the parent command's first `Use:` literal was scanned.
- Broad scans risked rewarding unregistered command files or dead files inside imported sibling packages.

## What Didn't Work

Reading fixed filenames such as `internal/cli/helpers.go`, `internal/client/client.go`, or `internal/cli/sync.go` worked for standard REST prints but contradicted the sanctioned non-REST path. Broadening to all CLI files was also insufficient: it could follow imports from orphan command files and count scoring strings from unreachable sibling-package files.

## Solution

Build scorer evidence from the registered command surface:

- Seed CLI reachability from `root.go`, framework helper files, and constructors reachable through Cobra `AddCommand` calls.
- Follow child command constructors so subcommands split across files remain visible.
- Follow internal package imports from reachable files, but include only sibling-package files that define called symbols plus same-package callees.
- Reuse the local-data signal used by the reimplementation check, including raw `database/sql` access paired with `sql.Open` or `sql.OpenDB`.
- Run sync correctness and pagination AST checks against the same reachable files used by output and error scoring.

## Why This Works

The scorer now evaluates behavior a user or agent can actually reach. It gives non-REST CLIs credit for their real implementation while preserving the anti-gaming boundary: orphan commands, dead generic scaffolds, and unused sibling-package files do not inflate scores.

## Prevention

When adding scorecard heuristics, prefer registered-command reachability over hardcoded filenames. If a dimension needs paired signals, keep those pairs within the same source unit unless cross-file matching is deliberately justified. Add both positive reachable-package tests and negative dead-code tests so future broadening does not reintroduce scorer inflation.
